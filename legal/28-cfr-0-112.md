## Legal Context and Historical Development

### Origin and Purpose

28 CFR § 0.112 is part of the Code of Federal Regulations, specifically Title 28 (Judicial Administration), Chapter I (Department of Justice), Part 0 (Organization of the Department of Justice), Subpart T (United States Marshals Service). This regulation provides specific authorization for the Director of the U.S. Marshals Service to deputize certain categories of individuals to serve as Special Deputy U.S. Marshals.

The regulation was originally promulgated to formalize and clarify the long-standing historical practice of deputization by U.S. Marshals, which dates back to the Judiciary Act of 1789. The current form of the regulation has been in place since a significant update to the Department of Justice regulations in the early 1980s, with minor amendments since.

### Related Regulations

28 CFR § 0.112 operates within a broader regulatory framework:

- **28 CFR § 0.111** outlines the general functions of the U.S. Marshals Service
- **28 CFR § 0.19(a)(3)** grants the Associate Attorney General authority to designate certain persons for deputation
- **28 CFR § 0.113** addresses the authority of the U.S. Marshals to carry firearms
- **28 USC § 561** establishes the U.S. Marshals Service as a bureau within the Department of Justice

## Detailed Analysis by Subsection

### Section (a): Department of Justice Employees

This subsection allows for the deputation of selected Department of Justice employees. This typically includes:

- Analysts and investigators assigned to task forces
- Department attorneys who may need limited law enforcement authority in certain situations
- Administrative personnel who support Marshals operations in sensitive contexts

The key limitation here is "selected," indicating that deputation is not automatic for all DOJ employees but requires specific designation.

### Section (b): Law Enforcement Officers

This subsection addresses the deputation of other law enforcement officers, including:

- Federal officers from other agencies (e.g., ATF, FBI, or Customs agents)
- State police or highway patrol officers
- Local police or sheriff's deputies

The critical qualifying phrase is "whenever the law enforcement needs of the U.S. Marshals Service so require," which establishes that such deputations must be justified by specific operational needs, not merely for convenience.

Common scenarios include:

1. **Multi-jurisdictional task forces** targeting fugitives
2. **Court security** during high-profile trials
3. **Witness protection** operations crossing jurisdictional boundaries
4. **Execution of federal warrants** in areas with limited federal presence

### Section (c): Private Security Personnel

This subsection specifically addresses the deputation of private security personnel for courthouse security. This provision recognizes that:

1. The federal judiciary has specialized security needs
2. Contract security personnel often supplement Deputy U.S. Marshals in courthouses
3. These personnel require limited law enforcement authority to properly secure federal court facilities

This deputation is strictly limited to courtroom and courthouse security functions and does not extend to other law enforcement activities.

### Section (d): Other Designated Persons

This "catch-all" provision provides flexibility by authorizing the Associate Attorney General to designate other persons for deputation. This authority is referenced in 28 CFR § 0.19(a)(3), which states that the Associate Attorney General is responsible for "[d]esignating personnel to act as Special Deputy United States Marshals."

This provision has been used in various contexts, including:

1. Emergency response situations
2. Protection of specific high-risk facilities or events
3. Special operations requiring unique skills or expertise

### Expiration Requirement

The final sentence of the regulation requires that "all such deputations shall expire on a date specified by the Director." This ensures that:

1. Special deputations are temporary rather than permanent
2. Each deputation has a clear termination point
3. Extensions require affirmative action rather than continuing by default
4. The Marshals Service maintains control over the duration of special deputy authority

## Practical Implementation

### Standard Operating Procedures

The U.S. Marshals Service has developed detailed internal procedures for implementing 28 CFR § 0.112, including:

1. **Application Process** - Standard forms and background checks
2. **Training Requirements** - Mandatory orientation and legal briefings
3. **Oath Administration** - Formal oath-taking ceremony
4. **Credential Issuance** - Specialized identification for special deputies
5. **Expiration Notification** - Process for terminating deputation at expiration

### Limitations on Authority

Special deputations under 28 CFR § 0.112 typically include specific limitations:

1. **Geographic Scope** - Authority may be limited to specific judicial districts
2. **Functional Scope** - Authority may be limited to specific duties or cases
3. **Chain of Command** - Special deputies must operate under USMS supervision
4. **Use of Force Policies** - Special deputies must adhere to DOJ use of force policies
5. **Firearms Restrictions** - Special requirements for carrying weapons

## Judicial Interpretation and Precedent

### Key Court Decisions

Several court cases have addressed aspects of special deputation under 28 CFR § 0.112:

1. **United States v. Torres, 862 F.2d 1025 (3rd Cir. 1988)** - Upheld the validity of evidence gathered by special deputies
2. **United States v. Sealed Case, 982 F.2d 45 (1st Cir. 1997)** - Addressed the scope of authority for specially deputized officers
3. **Kurtz v. Moffitt, 115 U.S. 487 (1885)** - Historical precedent recognizing the authority of deputy marshals

### Challenges to Authority

While courts have generally upheld the validity of actions taken by special deputies, challenges have been raised on various grounds:

1. **Scope of Authority** - Whether deputies exceeded their limited jurisdiction
2. **Proper Appointment** - Whether deputization procedures were properly followed
3. **Evidence Admissibility** - Whether evidence collected by special deputies is admissible
4. **Federal vs. State Jurisdiction** - Conflicts between federal deputization and state limitations

## Recent Applications and Examples

### Presidential Inaugurations

In January 2021, Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Lamont Ruffin from the D.C. District Court swore in approximately 2,000 National Guard troops as Special Deputy U.S. Marshals to assist with security for the presidential inauguration. This large-scale deputization was conducted under the authority of 28 CFR § 0.112(b).

Similarly, in January 2025, approximately 380 soldiers from the Virginia and Pennsylvania Army National Guard were deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service in preparation for the 60th Presidential Inauguration.

### Joint Task Forces

The U.S. Marshals Service regularly uses its deputation authority to create and maintain multi-jurisdictional fugitive task forces. For example, Operation North Star in 2022 involved the deputation of numerous state and local officers to participate in a coordinated fugitive apprehension operation.

## Conclusion

28 CFR § 0.112 provides the regulatory framework for special deputation by the U.S. Marshals Service. This authority is a critical tool enabling the Marshals Service to fulfill its diverse responsibilities in an effective and flexible manner while maintaining appropriate controls and limitations.

The regulation balances the need for operational flexibility with appropriate oversight and constraints, ensuring that special deputation serves its intended purpose of augmenting the capacity of the U.S. Marshals Service to carry out its statutory duties.
