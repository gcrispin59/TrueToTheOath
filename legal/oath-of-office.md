# Official Oath of Office for Special Deputy U.S. Marshals

## Legal Authority

The oath of office administered to Special Deputy United States Marshals is established by federal law under 5 U.S.C. ยง 3331. This is the same oath taken by all federal officers, including full-time Deputy U.S. Marshals, and affirms the deputy's commitment to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.

## Official Text of the Oath

> "I, [full legal name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."

## Administration of the Oath

The oath must be administered by a commissioned officer authorized to administer oaths. For Special Deputy U.S. Marshals, this is typically:

- The U.S. Marshal for the district
- A Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal
- Another authorized federal official as designated by the Director of the U.S. Marshals Service

## Legal Significance

Taking this oath has several important legal implications:

1. **Legal Binding**: The oath creates a legally binding obligation to uphold the Constitution and faithfully execute the duties of a Special Deputy U.S. Marshal.

2. **Authority**: Upon taking the oath, properly deputized individuals are granted limited federal law enforcement authority as specified in their deputation documents.

3. **Accountability**: Those who take the oath become subject to all applicable laws, regulations, and policies governing the conduct of federal law enforcement officers while acting in their capacity as Special Deputy U.S. Marshals.

4. **Penalties for Violation**: Violations of this oath may constitute a federal offense under various statutes, including 18 U.S.C. ยง 1001 (false statements) and 18 U.S.C. ยง 242 (deprivation of rights under color of law).

## Historical Context

The oath's roots trace back to the first Congress of the United States. The Judiciary Act of 1789, which established the U.S. Marshals Service, required all officers of the United States to take an oath to support the Constitution. The precise wording has evolved over time, but the fundamental commitment to uphold the Constitution has remained unchanged.

## Documentation Requirements

When the oath is administered to Special Deputy U.S. Marshals, the following documentation is required:

1. Signed and dated oath of office form (USM-306)
2. Record of the administering official
3. Witness signatures (if required by local protocol)
4. Official seal or stamp of the U.S. Marshals Service
5. Entry in the official record of deputations

## Temporal Limitations

Unlike the oath taken by career Deputy U.S. Marshals, the oath for Special Deputies is bound by the temporal limitations of the deputation itself. All special deputations expire on a date specified by the Director of the U.S. Marshals Service, as stipulated in 28 CFR ยง 0.112.

## Renewal

If a Special Deputy's term is extended, a new oath must be administered. The prior taking of the oath does not carry forward to subsequent deputations.
