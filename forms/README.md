# Forms and Templates

This directory contains XML templates and processing scripts for the registration system.

## Contents

- `registration-template.xml` - Template for the XML data structure generated by the registration form
- `email-template.html` - HTML email template for confirmation emails
- `process-registration.php` - PHP script for processing form submissions (if using server-side processing)
- `process-registration.js` - JavaScript for client-side form processing

## Implementation

The registration system is designed to collect information from interested individuals and format it as XML for processing by the U.S. Marshals Service or designated authorities.

## Customization

Organizations can customize the email templates and processing scripts to fit their specific needs, but should maintain the core XML structure for consistency across all participating organizations.
